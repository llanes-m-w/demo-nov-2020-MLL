            <!-- Instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich -->

            <h2>Unbeknownst to most, The Child likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches also.<br>
                Here he shares his favorite way to make a good PB&J:<br></h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the bag holding the loaf of sliced bread.</li>
                <li>Remove 2 slices of bread and insert them into the toaster.</li>
                <li>Toast the bread on the lowest, or second lowest setting.</li>
                <li>When the bread is done, remove the slices from the toaster and place them on a plate.</li>
                <li>Open the jar of peanut butter. Use a butter knife to scoop out peanut butter.</li>
                <li>Lightly spread the peanut butter over one of the slices of bread. The spread should be no more than 2mm in thickness.</li>
                <li>Repeat step 6 until the entire slice of bread is covered.</li>
                <li>Open the jar of jelly. Use a butter knife to scoop out jelly.</li>
                <li>Gently spread the jelly on the other slice of bread. The spread should be 2cm to 3cm thick.</li>
                <li>Repeat step 9 until the entire slice of bread is covered.</li>
                <li>Line up the 2 slices of bread carefully with the peanut butter side and the jelly covered side facing each other.</li>
                <li>Gently join the two slices of bread together, be careful not to smash them or put too much preasure when doing this. We do not want to have jelly squeeze out.</li>
                <li>You are now ready to enjoy your delicious Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich.</li>
            </ol>
